## My thoughts on Typescript so far...

So far I have mixed opinions about Typescript. [FreeCodeCamp’s Javascript tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) and [W3Schools’ Typescript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/index.php) were my first introduction to using these programming languages. Prior to completing the tutorials, I have had previous experience working with other programming languages such as Python, C, C++, and Java through other college courses. This made a majority of the concepts pretty easy to understand and self explanatory. However, I did struggle a little bit on the later stages of the tutorial, especially on the ES6 section. I just found the syntax of ES6 to be a bit confusing. Despite my struggles, learning Javascript, ES6, and Typescript was a great and fun learning experience. I haven’t coded in a while and I am a bit rusty so it was a good way to get my gears turning. I believe Typescript is a good programming language and that there are many things that make Typescript a good language to work on. Hopefully with more time and practice, I can get better at utilizing Typescript and ES6.

## Coding and Conditioning

As of the time I am writing this, I am taking ICS 314: Introduction to Software Engineering at UH Manoa, where a method of teaching known as “Athletic Software Engineering” is used. This class utilizes Athletic Software Engineering through high intensity activities called “Workout of the Day” (WOD), in which we must complete a given task within a set timeframe each week. Prior to the official WOD, we receive practice WODs to help us prepare. The difficulty of each activity usually corresponds to the given timeframe that is allocated for it. For instance, a simpler task might be assigned 20 minutes, whereas a more challenging task could be allotted up to 60 minutes. While this method of teaching can be quite stressful, I find it to be effective at what it does. I believe that this method will work well for me since it forces me to focus on the task at hand. Typically, I struggle with maintaining focus on assignments that don’t have immediate deadlines, but the nature of the WODs creates a sense of urgency and allows me to fully engage with each activity.
