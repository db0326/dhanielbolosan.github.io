## Rules and Regulations

At first glance, coding standards might seem like a bunch of unecessary nitpicky rules about indentation and using single quotation marks... and honestly, it definitely feels like that. While I recognize that coding standards help programmers write more efficient, readable, and cleaner code, I can't help but feel that following strict coding standards takes away the individuality in coding. Personally, I have my own way of writing code, but when using tools like ESLint, I often have to adjust the way I write my code. For example, here is a snippet of code that reflects my personal style:

```
function test(){
  console.log(testingtesting);
}
```

Here is how ESLint would suggest I should rewrite it:

```
function test(){
  console.log(testingtesting);
}
```
